Alistair is interested in web development, competitive programming, robotics, and math.
Additional hobbies he enjoys are welding and video games.
Other than progressing in USACO, a programming competition, and WMTC, a math competition, most of his goals revolve around projects such as programming a browser-based collaborative web editor to compete with replies or giving Adobe Connect a dark mode.
